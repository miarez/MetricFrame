# 📜 Project Manifesto

## 🔁 Single-Path Design

This system rejects multiple syntaxes for the same action. There is one canonical, predictable, learnable path for every operation, eliminating ambiguity and bikeshedding.

## 🧮 Data-First Worldview

The foundation is tabular thinking: rows, columns, joins, filters. The mental model aligns with SQL rather than object hierarchies or abstract inheritance structures.

## 🧩 Automatic Shape-Based Behavior

Data carries meaning through its structure. Matrices, vectors, dataframes, and time series infer their own valid operations and visualizations without additional instruction.

## 🧼 Zero Boilerplate

No scaffolding, no ceremony, no redundant code. Configuration expresses intention directly, without noise.

## 🎛️ Deterministic, Opinionated Defaults

Strong conventions guide usage. Flexibility is deliberately constrained. If there is a “different way,” the system chooses not to support it.

## 🌱 Beginner-Friendly → 🚀 Expert-Powerful

The interface is simple enough for newcomers, yet backed by an engine capable of compiling to highly efficient, high-performance execution.

## 📣 Declarative Over Imperative

Code describes outcomes, not procedures. The focus is on intent—similar to SQL or chart configuration grammars—rather than step-by-step construction.

## 🛠️ Total Abstraction of Engine Complexity

Implementation details of XY, Radial, Pie, and other engines remain invisible. Engines are swappable, while the configuration language stays consistent.

## 🧱 No Fragmentation

No plugins, no external packages, no sprawling ecosystems. Everything needed is built-in and unified under one coherent approach.

## 📊 Data Visualization as a First-Class Citizen

Charts are integral to the language’s grammar, not utilities bolted on top. Visualization is treated as a core mode of expression.
